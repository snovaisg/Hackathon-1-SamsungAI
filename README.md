# Hackathon-1-SamsungAI
 
 Welcome to the first hackathon of this course.

 # Data
 
 The data was collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maalona/hospital-triage-and-patient-history-data).

 The dataset contains about 5 million rows with around 217 columns. The first 17 should be demographic-related information and the remaining 200 are health indicators that are recorded at the time of the consult.

## Context

This data is from a retrospective study which included all adult ED (Emergency Department) visits between March 2014 and July 2017 from one academic and two community emergency rooms that resulted in either admission or discharge. Each row is a patient visit to the Yale New Haven Health system.

# Problem
You've recently been hired as a data scientist at WeCare Hospital. Your first task is to understand the data from the Emergency Department (ED). 

Your goal is to present your analysis to a team of healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses). Hopefully you will not only be able to describe accurately the population of patients of this hospital, but also find interesting insights using the health indicators you choose to focus on.

# Guideline

Here's a guideline to help you manage your time throughout this hackathon.

1. 20 minutes - to read and join the dataframes
2. 15 minutes - to choose a small set of cc_ columns to do your analysis on
    1. We suggest to choose 10 indicators max to focus on, but it's up to you in the end.
3. 45 minutes - to build simple analysis that can describe the population well in a high level
4. last 45 minutes - to try to ask more specific questions to the dataset. These should require you to leverage the use of **masks** and **groupbys**.

Whenever possible present your results with plots. You shouldn't need more than: bar plots, histograms, and line plots. But we leave it up to you if you decide to use other types of plots.


Good luck!
